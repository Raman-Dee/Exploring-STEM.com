                    STEM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in four specific disciplines — science,
                    technology, engineering and mathematics — in an interdisciplinary and applied approach. Rather than
                    teach the four disciplines as separate and discrete subjects, STEM integrates them into a cohesive
                    learning paradigm based on real-world applications.

                <h class="head2">1.Improves creativity</h>
                <p class="ex">
                    We’ve heard the saying “thinking outside of the box”, right? Well, creativity is truly the
                    centerpiece of a STEM education. STEM students are encouraged to come up with unique ideas and to
                    take on a diligent approach to solving complex issues.
                </p>






                <h class="head2">2. Increases team collaboration</h>

                <p class="ex">
                    Often times in the real world and in the workplace, teams are required to solve and complete
                    multifaceted problems. In light of this, STEM education prioritizes collaboration and teamwork in
                    its syllabus to teach to kids the importance of communication and leadership towards achieving
                    common goals.
                </p>


                <h class="head2"> 3.Develops communication skills</h>

                <p class="ex">Communication skills are perhaps the most important of all life skills. Having the ability
                    to
                    discuss and convey complex concepts to others while also learning from one another will be the key
                    to achieving success in a child’s life as they grow up. Group activities in STEM promote sociable
                    skills like active listening, open-mindedness, and open them up to giving and receiving constructive
                    feedback.</p>

                <h class="head2">4. Empowers critical thinking skills</h>

                <p class="ex">
                    The kind of material offered in a STEM education is focused on engaging kids in critical thinking.
                    Critical thinking is the process of actively conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, and evaluating
                    information through observation, experience, reflection, reasoning or communication. As such,
                    students will be encouraged to answer questions or solve problems not based on memorization but
                    based on actively engaging with the material to understand the issue at hand and solve it using
                    logic. These kinds of situations better reflect what is expected of them in the workplace –
                    experiencing situations like this early in their education will better prepare them for their
                    futures.

                </p>


                <h class="head2"> 5. Boosts curiosity</h>

                <p class="ex">
                    STEM is all about empowering kids to ask “why” and “how” questions. STEM will provide students the
                    opportunity to explore their imaginations to come up with imaginative solutions. Curious students
                    are invested in their education and are the driving force of innovation and discovery.

                </p>

                <h class="head2">
                    6.Improves cognitive skills
                </h>

                <p class="ex">
                    Cognitive skills are the brain-based skills that enhance thinking, reading and learning. Much like a
                    muscle, it can be exercised and strengthened through training. When engaged in STEM subjects,
                    students can develop and strengthen their cognitive skills and learn the basics of coding and
                    engineering in primary schools. This approach will develop kids’ cognitive abilities and aid them in
                    the speed and quality of their problem-solving skills.
                </p>

                <h class="head2">
                    7. Introduces STEM careers at early ages
                </h>

                <p class="ex">
                    Studies show that a majority of careers will be centered around STEM subjects or will have STEM
                    components to them. By introducing STEM at an early stage of a child’s life, you are introducing
                    them to a world of opportunities and nurturing the skills needed to succeed in the 21st-century.

                </p>



                <h class="head2"> 8. Teaches how to take initiative</h>

                <p class="ex">
                    Learning is evolving into more of a fun activity. STEM gives curious students the skills to tackle
                    problems confidently and facilitates a more positive feeling about learning, greater self-confidence
                    in students, and diffuses negative biases that contribute to the growth of individuals who are
                    curious, confident and take the initiative when dealing with challenges.

                    9. Enhances media literacy
                </h>

                <p class="ex">
                    Unlike other curriculums or syllabus, STEM students learn by research and inquiry. Inquiry requires
                    students to engage in active learning by generating their own driving questions and seeking out
                    answers through reading and research. In this way, they can apply what they have learned to daily
                    life.
                </p>

                <h class="head2">
                    10. Boosts social-emotional
                </h>

                <p class="ex">
                    Social-emotional abilities bring about happiness and success in life. STEM education encourages
                    children to improve their SEL skills before becoming active members of society. Aside from personal
                    development, including SEL strategies in teaching empower students to learn more academically.

                    Girls and women are systematically tracked away from science and math throughout their period while
                    studying, due to this misogynistic treatment it limits their training and options to go into the
                    fields as adults.


                    <br>
                    Women consist of only 28% of the workforce in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), and
                    men vastly outnumber women majoring in most STEM fields in college. The gender gaps are particularly
                    high in some of the fastest-growing and highest-paid jobs of the future, like computer science and
                    engineering.

                    <br>

                    Giving women equal opportunities to pursue and thrive in STEM careers helps narrow the gender pay
                    gap, enhances women’s economic security and ensures a diverse and talented STEM workforce and
                    prevents any type of discrimination in these fields and the products and services they produce.
                    <br>
                    A typical STEM worker earns two-thirds more than those employed in other fields, according to
                    reports by Pew Research Center. And some of the highest-earning STEM occupations, such as computer
                    science and engineering, have the lowest percentages of women workers.

                <p class="ex">
                    •Gender Stereotypes: STEM fields are often viewed as masculine, and teachers and parents often
                    underestimate girls’ math abilities start as early as preschool.<br><br>

                    •Male-Dominated Cultures: Because fewer women study and work in STEM, these fields tend to
                    perpetuate inflexible, exclusionary, male-dominated cultures that are not supportive of or
                    attractive to women and minorities.<br><br>

                    •Fewer Role Models: girls have fewer role models to inspire their interest in these fields, seeing
                    limited examples of female scientists and engineers in books, media and popular culture. There are
                    even fewer role models of Black women in math and science.<br><br>

                <p class="ex">*A gendered math gap exists in elementary school — but it is really only evident among
                    boys from higher-income and predominantly white areas performing significantly higher in math, even
                    compared to girls attending those same schools.<br><br>

                    *Girls score higher than boys in math in lower-income, predominantly Black areas (representing
                    around one-quarter of school districts), but their scores are still disproportionately low compared
                    to scores for white boys in high-income areas.<br><br>

                    *By the time students reach college, women are significantly underrepresented in STEM majors — for
                    instance, only around 21% of engineering majors are women and only around 19% of computer and
                    information science majors are women.<br><br>
